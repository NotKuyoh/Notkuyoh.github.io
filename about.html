        <h2>About Me & My Project</h2>
        <p>
          When I moved into a <mark>larger home</mark>, I quickly realized the
          <mark>everyday tasks</mark> I had taken for granted were no longer as
          simple as they once were. Switching lights on and off, adjusting the
          temperature, or even monitoring the state of various devices around
          the house felt like a <mark>hassle</mark>. I wanted a
          <mark>smarter way to manage my home</mark>. Something that would make
          life <mark>easier</mark>, <mark>more connected</mark>, and
          <mark>more efficient</mark>. That's when the idea for my project,
          <mark>JOI™</mark> (short for "Just One Intelligence"), was born — a
          <mark>voice assistant</mark> designed to manage all these tasks and
          more, all with the <mark>convenience of my voice</mark>.
        </p>

        <h3>Why I Started This Project</h3>
        <p>
          I started with a simple idea: create something that could help
          <mark>automate my home</mark>. But like many great ideas, this one
          began to <mark>evolve</mark>. As I dug deeper, I realized that
          <mark>existing smart home assistants</mark> came with a major
          downside: they were tied to <mark>large corporations</mark>. This
          meant I had <mark>little control over my own data</mark>. I wanted
          something <mark>more personal</mark>, something I could
          <mark>fully trust</mark>. That’s when I decided to build my own voice
          assistant, from the ground up, with
          <mark>privacy and independence at its core</mark>.
        </p>

        <h3>Learning & Development</h3>
        <p>
          At the very beginning, I had
          <mark>no experience in programming</mark>. But I didn’t let that stop
          me. I turned to the wealth of knowledge available online, using
          resources like <mark>ChatGPT, YouTube, and GitHub</mark> to learn
          Python. I bought a <mark>Raspberry Pi 3 Zero</mark>, an
          <mark>ESP32</mark>, and an <mark>Arduino</mark>, and started
          experimenting. My first successful project was
          <mark>controlling lights behind my TV</mark> using an LED strip and
          ESP32, which I programmed to run with the <mark>WLED software</mark>.
          The excitement of making something work got me <mark>hooked</mark>.
          But as I looked around my home, I realized there was
          <mark>more to be done</mark>. I wanted to
          <mark
            >control every light, every device, and every aspect of my
            home</mark
          >
          seamlessly. That’s when the idea of a
          <mark>Smart Voice Assistant</mark> started to take shape.
        </p>

        <h3>Challenges & Motivation</h3>
        <p>
          The journey from there was a <mark>steep learning curve</mark>. I
          started by creating a
          <mark>rule-based intent recognition system</mark>, but soon realized I
          needed something more advanced to make conversations feel
          <mark>natural</mark>. That’s when I decided to incorporate
          <mark>Llama</mark>, an <mark>AI model</mark>, to handle
          <mark>non-rule-based inputs and responses</mark>.
          <mark>JOI™</mark> became something more than just a tool — she became
          an <mark>intelligent assistant</mark> that could
          <mark>interact with me in a more human way</mark>. I named her
          <mark>JOI™</mark> after my friend, whose favorite movie is
          <mark>Blade Runner</mark> and whose favorite role is called
          <mark>JOI™</mark>. The name felt fitting, as it represented something
          both <mark>futuristic and personal</mark>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Despite the many <mark>challenges</mark> I faced, including learning
          from scratch and solving technical issues, I remained
          <mark>motivated</mark>. Coding can be time-consuming, and the journey
          is rarely smooth. Bugs, errors, and unexpected obstacles are part of
          the process. But every time I <mark>fixed a problem</mark> or saw a
          project come to life, the <mark>sense of accomplishment</mark> fueled
          my drive. There was something incredibly satisfying about creating a
          <mark>fully functional assistant</mark> that could handle so many
          tasks.
        </p>

        <h3>Personal Use & Sharing the Code</h3>
        <p>
          <mark>JOI™</mark> started as a <mark>personal project</mark>,
          something built for <mark>my own use</mark>. I didn’t initially plan
          to <mark>share the source code</mark> with the world, but as the
          project grew, I started to consider it. After all, the project’s
          journey could be helpful to others who are on the same path or looking
          to create their own <mark>smart home solutions</mark>. Still, I’ve yet
          to make that decision, as the project is very personal to me and I
          want to make sure it’s <mark>ready</mark> before opening it up to the
          public.
        </p>

        <h3>Future Vision</h3>
        <p>
          Looking forward, I have <mark>big plans</mark> for <mark>JOI™</mark>.
          My goal is to place the code on a <mark>running device</mark> that I
          can <mark>access from anywhere</mark>, allowing me to control my home
          no matter where I am. But that’s just the beginning. I’m also
          considering integrating <mark>JOI™ with smart glasses</mark> to bring
          the assistant’s features even closer to me, making it truly
          <mark>hands-free and seamless</mark>.
        </p>

        <h3>Conclusion</h3>
        <p>
          Creating <mark>JOI™</mark> has been an
          <mark>incredible journey</mark>. From <mark>learning to code</mark> to
          developing something that truly makes <mark>life easier</mark>, it’s
          been both challenging and rewarding. I can’t wait to see where the
          project goes from here, and I’m
          <mark
            >excited about the future of smart, independent home
            automation</mark
          >.
        </p>
        <p>
          Thank you for taking the time to read my story. I hope you find
          <mark>JOI™</mark> as exciting and useful as I do!
